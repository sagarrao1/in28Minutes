 old file classes are deprecated
 we need to use Buffered file classes for better readable and write to file system
 Beffered stream can improve effeciency
 buffers content in memory
 performs read/write in large chunks
 reduces underlying stream interaction
 
 BufferedReader
 BufferedWriter
 BufferedInputstream
 BufferedOutputStream
 
 line breaks vary across platform
 
 Unix
  \n (new line)
  
  Windows
   \r\n (CarriageReturn & new line)
   
 
 Buffered Stream add line break support
   uses correct value for current platform
   BufferedWriter
   	Generate Line breaks: newLine()
   	BufferedReader
   	 Line based read : readLine()
