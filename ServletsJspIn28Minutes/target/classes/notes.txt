Verify whether user logged in or not in every page

1. what logic we need to implement to identify user logged in or not ?

	best way is to add user name in session and see if name is not not null means user is logged in

2. where to implement this logic to verify in every servlet ?

	there is convcept called Filter in servlet which intercepts  every servlet request and and whether user logged in or
	no need to add logic in every servlet page
	
	we need to implement for all *.do servlets
	
	
	Filter
	LoginRequiredFilter
	*.do
	
	
	if there is a name in the session
		we will allow the request to go throgh as usal
	 else
	   we redirect to login page
