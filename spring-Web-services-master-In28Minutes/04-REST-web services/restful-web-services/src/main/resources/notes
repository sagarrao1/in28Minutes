		<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.springfox/springfox-boot-starter 
		 It will work with only spring boot >= 2.2-->
<!-- 		<dependency>
		    <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
		    <artifactId>springfox-boot-starter</artifactId>
		    <version>3.0.0</version>
		</dependency>
 -->
 
 To enable actuator in non prod, we need add below property in application.properties file
 we should not enable it in prod as it has performace impact
 
 manager

http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html



=============================
actuator :

we  need to setup below 2 jars for actuator
 <!-- Actuatior prodvides monitering and it requires hal browser to see-->
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-data-rest-hal-browser</artifactId>
		</dependency>


urls:
http://localhost:8080/actuator

http://localhost:8080/application

type http://localhost:8080/ in browser, it will open in hal browser as we have configured it


==============================

filtering :  let's you have 3 ffields in your bean , but you want to send only 2 fields in response when you are sending in json
 like filtering passwords that you don't want to send out
 you use filter to ignore that field in you bean using @JsonIgnore annotations
 static filtering

dynamic filtering : in static filtering you need to use @JsonIgnore annotation in each field and also like if you want filer on field 
in one method and another field in another menthod , you need to use dynamic filter

you will filter at your controller not at your bean level


========================================================
Versioning

Different types of versioning
look PersonVersionController class

1. Versioning using URI's
	Twitter uses
	
2. Versioning using rquest parameter
	Amazon uses

3.Versioning using headers 
  	Microsoft

4. Versioning using produces mime type versioning
	Mediatype versioning (accept header or a.k.a content negotiation)
	GitHub uses
	

==============================

Security
we need to add spring boot security jar in pom.xml

it will make all requests secure meaning asks for password
pass will be written to console
we need to select authorization in request header and provide user and password before submitting request
if you want to use your own user and password, we need to set it in application.properties
it is a very basic authentication
